# GCP Logs

:construction: This package is currently under development :construction:

This package is designed to be used with Nest.js. It provides a standard for logging in accordance with Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) logging system. The package utilizes the Winston logging library to facilitate the creation and management of logs. This makes it easier to maintain consistent, high-quality logs across your application, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

To use this package in a Nest.js application, you will need to integrate it into your Nest.js services. This can be done by importing the package and using it as a provider in your Nest.js modules.

Please note that this package is specifically tailored for use with GCP and may not be suitable for other cloud platforms or logging systems.
